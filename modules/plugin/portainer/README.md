# Portainer plugin module

## About this module

Thi s module will spin up a Portainer container after Docker was installed.
It is used to provide a UI for managing containers.

Therefore it is not well integrated yet. In the future I plan to make most
actions achievable via Portainer. If that does not work, this plugin may be dropped
in favour of a regular application one can deploy.
